Compilation:
	Only golang standard library was used so only need to have golang installed to compile
    Download Libraries by running
        $go get github.com/mackerelio/go-osstat/network
        $go get github.com/mackerelio/go-osstat/disk
	To compile run in source direction
		$go build
	
	After it is compiled make sure to update the package directory by running
		$sudo cp ./source  ../netdrive/usr/local/bin/netDrive
		$sudo chmod 755  ../netdrive/usr/local/bin/netDrive
		$sudo chown root:root ../netdrive/usr/local/bin/netDrive
Running Service:
	To start run
		$sudo /etc/init.d/netDrive start &
	To Stop
		$sudo /etc/init.d/netDrive stop
	
	Logs are stored at /usr/local/bin/drive.txt  and /usr/local/bin/network.txt
Building .deb
	To build a .deb you put the files in a tree such as they will be installed with the root folder of the package acting as / in your filesystem
		The file tree of the package is
			cpuUsage/ (ROOT)
				DEBIAN/
					control
				etc/
					init.d/
						netDrive
				usr/
					local/
						bin/
							netDrive
							drive.txt
                            network.txt
		To edit package edit this filetree
		netDrive/DEBIAN/control holds metadata needed for the package but it is mainly just description name and maintainer for repositories
		
		To build package (Run all command in highest folder):
			$dpkg-deb --build netdrive
		To Install:
			 $sudo dpkg -i netdrive.deb
		The .deb file can be installed on any ubuntu system and put onto a repo for quick instalation
NOTE: Due to linux updating drive and network io less frequently then cpu usage I lowered the logs from 1 every 2 seconds to 1 every 30 to make it not wasteful and disorganized by
